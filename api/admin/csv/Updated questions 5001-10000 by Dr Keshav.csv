They can be grouped into two major categories: guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins and non-receptorassociated tyrosine kinases. GTP-binding proteins include the ras family and the G proteins. Mutation of the ras gene is the single most common abnormality of dominant oncogenes in human tumors and is found in about one-third of all human tumors. Normal ras protein (p21) flips back and forth between an activated, signal-transmitting form and an inactive state. In the inactive state, p21 binds GDP, but when cells are stimulated by growth factors, p21 becomes activated by exchanging GDP for GTP, and it can then stimulate MAP kinases and protein kinase C. In normal cells the activated sinaltransmitting stage of ras protein bound to GTP is transient because its intrinsic GTPase activity hydrolyzes GTPto GDP, which returns it to its inactive state. The GTPase activity of normal ' ras protein is accelerated by GTPaseactivating proteins (GAPs), which function as brakes to prevent uncontrolled ras activity. Mutant 7, ras proteins bind GAP, but their GTPase activity is not increased, trapping the mutant proteins in their excited,GTP-bound form."

5594,Pathology,neoplasia,The product of the p53 antitumor gene is a nuclear protein that regulates DNA replication and prevents the proliferation of cells with damaged DNA by stopping their cell cycle,Between G1 and S,Between G2 and M,Between M and G1,Between S and G2,,1,"In contrast to proto-oncogenes, which are genes that encodefor proteins stimulating cell growth, cancer suppressor genes(antioncogenes) encode for proteins that suppress cellgrowth. Examples of tumor suppressor genes are Rb(associated with retinoblastoma), p53, APC, NF1, and Wtl.In general, these tumor suppressor genes encode proteinsthat can function as cell surface molecules, regulators ofsignal transduction,or regulators of nuclear transcription.Genes that regulate nuclear transcription include Rb,p53,andWT1. Products of these genes are found within the nucleus andare involved in regulation of the cell cycle. The product of theRb gene is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates the cellcycle at several points. It exists as an active unphosphorylatedform (pRb) and an inactive phosphorylated form (pRb-P).The active unphosphorylated form (pRb) normally stops thecell cycle at G1 going to S. It does this by binding totranscription factors such as the product of c-myc and the E2Fprotein. When pRb is phosphorylated, the cell can enter S andcomplete the cell cycle. Inactivation of the pRb stop signalcauses the cell to continually cycle and undergo repeatedmitosis.The product of the p53 gene is also a nuclear protein thatregulates DNA replication. The normal p53 prevents thereplication of cells with damaged DNA. It does this by pausingcells during G1 (before S), giving the cells time to repair thedamaged DNA.The p53 gene, located on chromosome 17, is thesingle most common target for genetic alterations in humancancers."

The tumor cells first must become discohesiveand detach from the primary site and then attach elsewhere tobecome metastases.Tumor cells tend to have many more lamininreceptors than do normal cells, allowing them to attach morereadily to basement membranes at distant sites. Keratin is a markerof epithelial differentiation, not metastatic ability. A reduction inapoptosis allows greater proliferation, but not metastases.Monoclonality is a feature of neoplasia, but further tumorheterogeneity helps to increase the chance for metastases to occur.Inflammation probably does not playa major role in metastasis."

The complex IgG-heparin-PF can bind to platelets by the platelet Fc receptor and lead to thrombocytopenia by destruction of the sensitized platelets in the spleen. However, the complex can also form bridges between platelets and induce aggregation with platelet activation and the potential for thrombus formation.

5734,Pathology,hematology,"A 5-year-old boy is being evaluated for recurrent epistaxis and other abnormal bleeding episodes, including excessive bleeding from the umbilical cord at birthLaboratory studies reveal the following: decreased hemoglobin (with microcytic hypochromic red cell indices), normal platelet count, markedly prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT),and unmeasurable thrombin time (TT)Platelet aggregation studies reveal a normal platelet response to ristocetin, but with other substances (including collagen, ADP, and epinephrine), this patient's platelets exhibit a primary wave defectBased on these findings, this patient most likely has",Afibrinogenemia,Bernard-Soulier syndrome,Glanzmann's thrombasthenia,Gray platelet syndrome,,1,"Platelet aggregation refers to platelets binding to other platelets.One mechanism forthis involves fibrinogen, which can act as a molecular bridge between adjacent platelets by binding to Gpllb and Gpllla receptors on the surface of platelets. Abnormalities of platelet aggregation (aggregation defects or primary wave defects) include Glanzmannâ€™s thrombasthenia and afibrinogenemia. Patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia have a deficiency of Gpllb-llla and defective platelet aggregation. Patients with low or no fibrinogen levels characteristically have prolonged PT, PTT, and TT values: in fact, theyare so prolonged theyare unmeasurable.In contrast to platelet aggregation, platelet secretion refers to the secretion of the contents of two types ofgranules within the platelet cytoplasm, a granules contain fibrinogen, fibronectin, and platelet-derived growth factor, while dense bodies contain ADP, ionized calcium, histamine, epinephrine, and serotonin. Decreased platelet secretion (activation defects) is seen with deficiencies of these granules; these diseases are called storage pool defects. They can involve either a granules (gray platelet syndrome) or dense bodies (Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome,or TAR)."

In this disorder, neoplastic B cells differentiate to IgM-producing cells; there is a monoclonal IgM spike in the serum.These IgM molecules aggregate and produce hyperviscosity, and some of them agglutinate at low temperatures and produce cold agglutinin disease. There is typically no leukemic phase to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. Myeloma, which is typically accompanied by a monoclonal gammopathy, most often does not cause liver and spleen enlargement, and morphologically, the cells resemble plasma cells.

Acute disseminated Langerhans cell histiocytosis (Letterer-Siwe disease) affects children before the age of 3 years, These children have cutaneous lesions that resemble seborrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. The Langerhans cells infiltrate the marrow, which leads to anemia, thrombocytopenia,and recurrent infections.The clinical course is usually rapidly fatal.Multifocal Langerhans cell histiocytosis (Hand-Schuller- 9.Christian disease) usually begins between the second and sixth years of life. The characteristic triad consists of bone lesions, particularly in the calvarium and the base of the skull; diabetes insipidus; and exophthalmos.

Although IS. the increased RBC mass is responsible for most of the symptoms and signs, these patients also have thrombocytosis and granulocytosis. This occurs because, similar to other 16. myeloproliferative disorders, polycythemia vera results from transformation of a multipotent stem cell.The high hematocrit concentration causes an increase in blood volume and distention of blood vessels.The neoplastic erythroid progenitor cells require extremely small amounts of erythropoietin for survival and proliferation; the levels of erythropoietin are virtually undetectable in polycythemia vera. When combined with abnormal platelet function, this condition predisposes the patient to bleeding. Abnormal platelet function also can predispose to thrombosis. The pruritus and peptic ulceration most likely are the result of the histamine release from basophils. In some patients, the disease ""burns outâ€ù to myelofibrosis.

The development of Libman-Sacks endocarditis is associated with the presence of the lupus anticoagulant (antiphospholipid syndrome), an antibody that makes platelets ""sticky"" and increases the chance of thrombosis."

The mutations affect genes that encode proteins of cardiac contractile elements. The most common mutation in the inherited forms affects the [3-myosin heavy chain. Hemochromatosis can give rise to cardiomyopathy, but it occurs much later in life; amyloidosis causes restrictive cardiomyopathy. Autoimmune conditions are unlikely to involve the myocardium."
6356,Pathology,CVS,A factor that stimulates the proliferation of smooth-muscle cells and also relates to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is:,Platelet-derived growth factor,Transforming growth factor 3,Interleukin 1,Interferon a,Tumor necrosis factor,1,"The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis depends in part on the inflammatory function of macrophages, which involves the release of numerous cytokines.Plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) is mitogenic and chemotactic for smoothmuscle cells. This may explain the recruitment and proliferation of smooth-muscle cells in atherosclerosis.Other macrophage products participate in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis by other means.Interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) transform the normally anticoagulant endothelial surface into a procoagulant surface by stimulating endothelial cells to produce plateletactivating factor (PAF), tissue factor (TF), and plasminogen activator inhibitor(PAI).Interferon a and transforming growth factor [3 inhibit cell proliferation. This could explain the failure of endothelial cells to repairendothelial defects.These defects could then either provide entry areas for lipoproteins and plasma-derived factors or serve as an area where thrombi are formed."
6357,Pathology,CVS,"Histologic sections from an irregular, enlarging brown lesion on the left forearm of a 23-year-old male who is HIV-positive would most likely reveal",Irregular vascular spaces lined by nests of uniform cells,Multiple dilated endothelial-lined vessels that lack red blood cells,"Proliferating blood vessels, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts",Proliferating spindle stromal cells with slit like spaces and extravasation of erythrocytes,,5,"Kaposi sarcoma is characterized by purple maculopapular skin lesions of the lower extremities. In the early stages, irregular, dilated epidermal vascular spaces, extravasated red cells, and hemosiderin are characteristic. Later in the disease process, more characteristic lesions show spindle cells around slit spaces with extravasation of erythrocytes.In contrast, irregular vascular spaces lined by nests of uniform cells describes the histologic appearance of a glomus tumor, while multiple dilated endothelial-lined vessels that lack red blood cells describes the histologic appearance of lymphangiomas.Numerous neutrophils, nuclear dust, and purple granules characterize bacillary angiomatosis, while proliferating blood vessels, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts suggest granulation tissue."
6358,Pathology,CVS,A 30-year-old male smoker presents with gangrene of his extremitiesWhich one of the following histologic findings from a biopsy of the blood vessels supplying this area would be most suggestive of the diagnosis of Buerger's disease?,Granulomatous inflammation with giant cells,Fibrinoid necrosis with overlying thrombosis,Fragmentation of neutrophils,Thrombosis with microabscesses,,4,"Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is characterized by segmental acute and chronic inflammation of intermediate and small arteries. This disorder almost always occurs in cigarette smokers at a young age (usually below 35 years) and is often associated with HLA-A9,B5 genotypes. It used to be found exclusively in men, but recently there has been an increase in the number of reported cases in women. The vessels primarily affected are in the extremities, and this leads to painful ischemia and gangrene of the legs and arms due to thrombosis. Histologic sections reveal an acute inflammatory infiltrate involving the entire wall of the vessel. In contrast to atherosclerosis, small microabscesses may be seen within thrombi. The inflammation leads to intimal proliferation that obliterates the lumen and causes pain.Granulomatous inflammation with giant cells involving blood vessels can be seen with temporal arteritis or Takayasu's arteritis. Fragmentation of neutrophils surrounding blood vessels is called leukocytoclastic vasculitis, the differential for which includes microscopic polyarteritis nodosa,Henoch-Schonlein purpura, Wegener's granulomatosis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome."

Edema fromation underthese conditons amy bethe consequence of a primary formof renal salt and water retention.This pathogenic sequencefor edema fromation is called the overfill mechanism.Note: Undoubtedly each of these mechanisms plays a rolein various phases and forms of nephrotic svndrome.

Neutrophils may be seen within the colonic epithelium, and, if present within the lumens of the crypts, may produce crypt abscesses. This latter change, however, is more commonly associated with ulcerative colitis. One important way to differentiate between these two inflammatory bowel diseases is the location of involved colon. Crohn's disease may affect any portion of the Gl tract, but most commonly there is involvement of the terminal ileum (regional enteritis) or the proximal portion (right side) of the colon. Gl involvement is segmental with skip areas. In contrast, almost all cases of ulcerative colitis involve the rectum, and involvement extends proximally (left side) without skip lesions (diffuse involvement)."

Ethanol is taken up by the liver and is corivertecT into acetaldehyde by either alcohol dehydrogenase (the major pathway), microsomal P-450 oxidase, or peroxisomal catalase.These pathways also convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH. This excess production of NADH changes the normal hepatic metabolism away from catabolism of fats and toward anabolism of fats (lipid synthesis), resulting in decreased mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids and increased hepatic production of triglyceride. Ethanol also increases lipolysis and inhibits the release of lipoproteins. Increased lipolysis increases the amount of free fatty acids that reach the liver"

6973,Pathology,CNS,Laminar necrosis and watershed infarcts are most suggestive of,Shock,Hypertension,Fat emboli,Vascular thrombosis,,1,"Decreased brain perfusion may be generalized (global) or localized. Global ischemia results from generalized decreased blood flow, such as with shock, cardiac arrest, or hypoxic episodes (e.g., near drowning or carbon monoxide poisoning). Global hypoxia results in watershed (border zone) infarcts, which typically occur at the border of areas supplied by the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, and laminar necrosis, which is related to the short, penetrating vessels originating from pial arteries. The Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and the pyramidal neurons of Sommer's sector in the hippocampus are particularly sensitive to hypoxic episodes. Atherosclerosis, which predisposes to vascular thrombi and emboli, is related to regional ischemia. Hypertension damages parenchymal arteries and arterioles, producing small ischemic lesions (lacunar infarcts). Fat emboli, related to trauma of long bones, lodge in small capillaries to form petechiae."
6974,Pathology,CNS,Neuronophagia of anterior horn neurons is characteristic of,JC virus infection,Treponema pallidum infection,Poliovirus infection,Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,,3,"Poliomyelitis is caused by an enterovirus that causes a nonspecific gastroenteritis and then secondarily invades the anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord. Microscopy reveals characteristicneuronophagia of anterior horn neurons; the dorsal roots are not affected. Infection causes acute muscular paralysis (atrophy, fasciculations, fibrillation, and hyporeflexia). Postpolio syndrome occurs more than 25 years later, with progressive weakness, decreased muscle mass, and pain. In contrast, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a viral infection of oligodendrocytes that causes demyelination and symptoms of dementia and ataxia. The causative agents of PML are two closely related papovaviruses, JC virus and SV40. The pathognomonic feature of PML is oligodendrocytes in areas of demyelination having aâ€œground-glass""appearance of their nuclei. PMLoccurs as a terminal complication in immunosuppressed individuals. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE),an encephalitis predominately of childhood, is usually related to previous measles infection, often at an unusuallyearlyage."
6975,Pathology,CNS,"A 41-year-old male presents with involuntary rapid jerky movements and progressive dementiaHe soon dies, and gross Examination of his brain reveals marked degeneration of the caudate nucleus.This individual's symptoms were caused by",Decreased functioning of GABA neurons,Increased functioning of dopamine neurons,Relative increased functioning of acetylcholine neurons,Relative decreased functioning of acetylcholine neurons,,5,"Huntington's disease, an autosomal dominant disorder that results from an abnormal gene on chromosome 4, involves the extrapyramidal system and atrophy of the caudate nuclei and putamen.Choreiform movements and progressive dementia appear after the age of 30. There is degeneration of GABA neurons in the striatum, which leads to decreased function (decreased inhibition) and increased movement. Huntington's disease is one of four diseases that are characterized by long repeating seguences of three nucleotides (the other diseases being fragile X syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy). Therapy for excessive movement (hyperkinetic) disorders can be attempted with dopamine antagonists. Decreased dopamine in the striatum theoretically causes a relative increase in acetylcholine and an increase in excitation in the striatum.This causes increased GABA function, which leads to increased inhibition of movement. The same result could theoretically be achieved with inhibition of acetylcholine breakdown (cholinesterase inhibitors).Compare this to the same treatment of hypokinetic (Parkinsonian) disorders. Dopamine agonists increase the inhibition in the striatum, leading to decreased GABA in the striatum and decreased inhibition of movement (increased movement). The same result could theoretically be achieved with anticholinergics"
6976,Pathology,CNS,Hypertension is most closely related to the formation of which one of the following types of aneurysms?,Berryaneurysm,Atherosclerotic aneurysm,Mycotic aneurysm,Charcot-Bouchard aneurysm,,4,"Hypertension results in the deposition of lipid and hyaline material in the walls of cerebral arterioles, which is called lipohyalinosis.This weakens the wall and forms small Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms, which may eventually rupture.Berry aneurysms (small saccular aneurysms) are the result of congenital defects in the media of blood vessels and are located at the bifurcations of arteries. Atherosclerotic aneurysms are fusiform (spindle-shaped) aneurysms usually located in the major cerebral vessels. They rarely rupture, but may become thrombosed. Mycotic (septic) aneurysms result from septic emboli,most commonly from subacute bacterialendocarditis"

Astrocytomas, the most common primary brain tumors in adults, range from low-grade to very highÂ¬grade (glioblastoma multiforme). These grades of astrocytomas include grade I (the least aggressive and histologically difficult to differentiate from reactive astrocytosis), grade II (some pleomorphism microscopically), grade III (anaplastic astrocytoma, characterized histologically by increased pleomorphism and prominent mitoses), and grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme). Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly malignant tumor characterized histologically by endothelial proliferation and serpentine areas of necrosis surrounded by peripheral palisading of tumor cells. It frequently crosses the midline (""butterfly tumor""). In contrast, schwannomas generally appear as extremely cellular spindle cell neoplasms, sometimes with metaplastic elements of bone, cartilage, and skeletal muscle. Medulloblastomas occur exclusively in the cerebellum and microscopically are highly cellular with uniform nuclei, scant cytoplasm, and, in about one-third of cases, rosette formation centered by neurofibrillary material.Oligodendrogliomas, which are marked by foci of calcification in 70% of cases, commonly show a pattern of uniform cellularity and are composed of round cells with small dark nuclei, clear cytoplasm, and a clearly defined cell membrane."

Clinically, this disease is a combination of lower motor neuron (LMN) disease with weakness and fasciculations and upper motor neuron (UMN) disease with spasticity and hyperreflexia. Early symptoms include weakness and cramping, then muscle atrophy and fasciculations. Reflexes are hyperactive in upper and lower extremities, and a positive extensor plantar (Babinski) reflex develops because of the loss of upper motor neurons.The triad of atrophic weakness of hands and forearms, slight spasticity of the legs, and generalized hyperreflexia-in the absence of sensory changes-suggests the diagnosis. The clinical course is rapid, and death may result from respiratory complications. There is no effective treatment for ALS. Theories about the etiology of ALS include viral infections, immunologic causes, or oxidative stress. The latter is related to a defect in zinc-copper binding superoxide dismutase (SOD) on chromosome 21. Decreased SOD activity leads to apoptosis of spinal motor neurons.In contrast, metachromatic leukodystrophy is an autosomal recessive disorder of sphingomyelin metabolism that results from deficiency of cerebroside sulfatase (aryl-sulfatase A). Sulfatides accumulate in lysosomes and stain metachromatically with cresyl violet. Diagnostic measures include amniocentesis, enzyme analysis, and measuring decreased urinary arylsulfatase A. Demyelination is widespread in the cerebrum and peripheral nervous system.Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (Guillain-Barre syndrome) is a life-threatening disease of the peripheral nervous system.The disease usually follows recovery from an influenza like upper respiratory tract infection and is characterized by a motor neuropathy that leads to an ascending paralysis that begins with weakness in the distal extremitiesand rapidly involves proximal muscles. Sensory changes are usually minimaLThe disease is thought to result from immune- mediated segmental demyelination.Huntington's disease is characterized by choreiform movements and progressive dementia that appear after the age of 30."
6980,Pathology,CNS,Which one of the listed statements describes a major risk factor for both sporadic Alzheimer's disease and late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease?,a-secretase cleavage of p-amyloid precursor protein,Expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats on chromosome 4,Ingestion of l-methyl-4-phenyl-tetrahydrobiopteridine,Presence of apolipoprotein E4,,5,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly (followed by vascular multi-infarct dementia and diffuse Lewy body disease). AD often begins insidiously with impairment of memory and progresses to dementia.The etiology is not well understood (age is the main risk factor), but it is clear that there are multiple etiologic pathways to this disease state. Late-onset familial and sporadic AD are associated with the presence of the E4 isotype of ApoE, this being the most important factor in the general population, p- amyloid (A-p) deposition is necessary but not sufficient for the development of Alzheimer's disease.The gene for p-amyloid is located on chromosome 21 (note the high incidence of Alzheimer's disease in individuals with trisomy 21).Cleavage of the p-amyloid precursor protein (p-APP) by a- secretase precludes p-A formation; cleavage by p- or y- secretases produces pathogenicfragments.Early-onset familial Alzheimer's is related to mutations in presenilins or p-APP. Histologically, AD is characterized by numerous neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques with a central core of amyloid a- protein. Both tangles and plaques are found to a lesser extent in other conditions, e.g., neurofibrillary tangles in Down's syndrome. Silver stains demonstrate tangles and plaques and Congo red shows amyloid deposition in plaques and vascular walls (amyloidangiopathy). In AD there are also numerous Hirano bodies, and granulovacuolar degeneration is found in more than 10% of the neurons of the hippocampus. Grossly, brain atrophy (narrowed gyri and widened sulci) is predominant in the frontal and superior temporal lobes.In contrast to AD, expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats on chromosome 4 is associated with Huntington's disease, ingestion of l-methyl-4- phenyl-tetrahydrobiopteridine is associated with production of Parkinsonian symptoms."

These disorders are associated with numerous types of autoantibodies, one of which is the anti-Jo-1 antibody. The capillaries are the principle target in patients with dermatomyositis. Damage is by complementmediated cytotoxic antibodies against the microvasculature of skeletal muscle. In addition to proximal muscle weakness, patients typically develop a lilac discoloration around the eyelids with edema. Patients may also develop erythema over their knuckles (Gorton's sign). Histologically, examination of muscles from patients with dermatomyositis reveals perivascular inflammation within the tissue that surrounds muscle fascicles.This is in contrast to the other types of inflammatory myopathies, where the inflammation is within the muscle fascicles (endomysial inflammation).

Sheets of fairly uniform-size epithelial cells that are typically arranged in either an antler-like pattern or a honeycomb pattern. Foam cells and apocrine cells may also be seen, although these are less diagnosticfeatures.Fibroadenoma of the breast is a benign tumor composed of two elements: epithelium and stroma.It is nodular and encapsulated, included in breast. Epithelial proliferation appears in a single terminal ductal unit and describes ductlike spaces surrounded by a fibroblastic stroma.Depending on the proportion and the relationship between these two components,there are two main histologicalfeatures A) Intracanalicularfibroadenoma:Stromal proliferation predominates and compresses the ducts,which are irrâ€™egular?reduced to slits.B) Pericanalicularfibroadenoma:fibrous stroma proliferates around the ductal spaces, so that they remain round or oval, on cross section.The basement membrane is intactFeatures that are suggestive of malignancy include loss of cell cohesion, increase in cell and/or nuclear size irregularity of the nuclear membrane clumping and uneven distribution of chromatin,as well multiple, abnormal nucleoli. Single nucleoli may be seen in reactive conditions and are not a criterion of malignancy on their own.Myoepithelial cells, which are abundant in benign proliferative lesions, are not seen in aspirates of invasive breast carcinoma. PHYLLO DESTUMORS:Are also fibroepithelial in composition, with the glandular element closely mimicking that of fibroadenoma. Ductal hyperplasia is much more common in phyllodestumors.The stromal component tends to be prominent with large stromal fragments that are hypercellular.

The ectopic endometrial tissue may be located within the myometrium or it may be found outside of the uterus. The former type, consisting of nests of endometrial stroma within the myometrium, is called adenomyosis. It is thought to result from the abnormal downgrowth of the endometrium into the myometrium. Ectopic endometrial tissue outside of the uterus is called endometriosis and histologically reveals endometrial glands, stroma, and hemosiderin pigment (from the cyclic bleeding). Repeated cyclic bleeding in patients with endometriosis can lead to the formation of cysts that contain areas of new and old hemorrhages. Because they grossly contain blood clots, these cysts have been called ""chocolate cysts.â€ù Endometriosis is thought to possibly arise from metaplasia of celomic epithelium into endometrial tissue, or implantation of normal fragments of menstrual endometrium either via the fallopian tubes or via the blood vessels. Other sites of endometriosis include the uterine ligaments (associated with dyspareunia), the rectovaginal pouch (associated with pain on defecation and low back pain), the fallopian tubes (associated with peritubular adhesions, infertility, and ectopic pregnancies), the urinary bladder (associated with hematuria), the Gl tract (associated with pain, adhesions, bleeding, and obstruction),and the vagina (associated with bleeding)."

This abnormality is seen in postmenopausal women, who develop pruritic white plaques of the vulva. It is not thought to be premalignant.Loss of pigment in the epidermis (vitiligo) can also produce leukoplakia. Inflammatory skin diseases, such as chronic dermal inflammation, squamous hyperplasia (characterized by epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis), and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (characterized by epithelial atypia or dysplasia), can also present with leukoplakia. Aterm related to leukoplakia is-yulvar dystrophy, but this refers specifically to either lichen sclerosis pr squamous hyperplasia. Because the latter is sometimes associated with epithelial dysplasia, it is also referred to as hyperplastic dystrophy. It is most commonly seen in postmenopausal women. The male counterpart of lichen sclerosis, called balanitis xerotica obliterans, is found on the penis. Paget's disease is a malignant tumor that can be found in the breast or the vulva. The latter is seen clinically as pruritic, red, crusted, sharply demarcated maplike areas.Histologically, these malignant lesions reveal single anaplastic tumor cells surrounded by clear spaces (""halos"") infiltrating the epidermis.These malignant cells stain positively with PAS and mucicarmine stains."

Hydatidiform moles are composed of avascular, grapelike structures that do not invade the myometrium. In complete (classic) moles,all the chorionic villi are abnormaland fetal parts are not found.They have a 46,XX diploid pattern and arise from the paternal chromosomes of a single sperm by a process called androgenesis. In partial moles, only some of the villi are abnormal and fetal parts may be seen.These moles have a triploid or a tetrapioid karyotype and arise from the fertilization of a single egg by two sperm. About 2% of complete moles may develop into choriocarcinoma, but partial moles are rarely followed by malignancy. Invasive moles penetrate the myometrium and may even embolize to distant sites. A similar lesion is the placental site trophoblastic tumor, which is characterized by invasion of the myometrium by intermediate trophoblasts."

Therefore, inflammation of the endometrium (endometritis) is rare. The diagnosis of endometritis\ depends on finding inflammatory cells within the endometrium that are not present during the normal menstrual cycle. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) are normally present during menstruation, while a stromal lymphocytic infiltrate can be seen at other times during the menstrual cycle. Lymphoid aggregates and lymphoid follicles may also be seen in normal endometrium. Therefore the presence of any of these types of leukocytes is not diagnostic of endometritis. Acute endometritis is usually (feused by bacterial infection following delivery or miscarriage and is characterized by the presence of neutrophils in endometrial tissue that is not menstrual endometrium. The histologic diagnosis of chronic endometritis depends on finding plasma cells within the endometrium.All it takes is one plasma,cell tj? make the diagnosis. Chronic endometritis may be seen in patients with intrauterine devices (IUDs), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), retained products of conception (postpartum),or tuberculosis.The latter is characterized histologically by the presence of caseating granulomas with Langhans giant cells. These are secondary causes of chronic endometritis. In a significant number of cases, no underlying cause is found."

It is most likely associated with an endocrine imbalance that causes an abnormality of the normal monthly cyclic events within the breast. These fibrocystic changes are subdivided into nonproliferative and proliferative changes.Nonproliferative changes include fibrosis of the stroma and cystic dilation ofthe terminal ducts, which when large may form bluedomed cysts. A common feature of the ducts in nonproliferative changes is apocrine metaplasia, which refers to epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with apical snouts.Proliferative changes include epithelial hyperplasia of the ducts. This hyperplastic epithelium may form papillary structures (papillomatosis when pronounced), or may be quite abnormal (atypical hyperplasia).Two benign, but clinically important, forms of proliferative fibrocystic change include sclerosing adenosis and radial scar. Both of these may be mistaken histologically for infiltrating ductal carcinoma, but the presence of myoepithelial cells is a helpful sign that points to the benign nature of the proliferation.Sclerosing adenosis is a disease of the terminal Lobules that is typically seen in patients 35 to 45 years old. It produces a firm mass, most often located in the upper outer quadrant. Microscopically there is florid proliferation of small ductal structures in a fibrous stroma, which on low power is stellate in appearance and somewhat maintains the normal Lobular architecture."

Traumatic fat necrosis differs from enzymatic fat necrosis because it does not involve the pancreatic enzyme lipase.Fat necrosis maybe confused clinically with cancer; however, in contrast to cancer,fat necrosis is painful. Numerous neutrophils are seen in acute bacterial infection of the breast (acute mastitis), which is usually seen in the postpartum lactating or involuting breast.If large numbers of plasma cells are also present, the lesion is called plasma cell mastitis.

It is frequently associated with the erb B2/ neu oncogene and a poor prognosis.Cribriform carcinoma is characterized by round, ductlike structures within the solid intraductal sheet of epithelial cells, while intraductal papillary carcinoma has a predominant papillary pattern.In contrast, invasive malignancies are characterized by infiltration of the stroma, which may produce a desmoplastic response within the stroma (schirrous carcinoma).Infiltrating ductal carcinomas also produce yellow-white chalky streaks that result from the deposition of elastic tissue around ducts (elastosis).
